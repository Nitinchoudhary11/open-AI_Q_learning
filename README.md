Q* Learning with OpenAI Taxi.
The goal of this game is that our agent must pick up the passenger at one location and drop him off to the goal as fast as possible.

There are 4 locations (labeled by different letters) and your job is to pick up the passenger at one location and drop him off in another.

You receive +20 points for a successful dropoff
Lose 1 point for every timestep it takes.
There is also a 10 point penalty for illegal pick-up and drop-off actions (if you don't drop the passenger in one of the 3 other locations)
